# R-projects

This repository contains all projects coded using R.
Sets of data were analyzed utilizing various R functions, as part of Emory University's QTM 100 course (Introduction to Statistical Inference). 

## lab1.R

Data on Alzheimer's Disease is analyzed utilizing R applications. Graphs are produced and descriptive statistics are identified utilizing this graph. 

## lab2.R

The distribution of lifespan among female fruitflies are analyzed. Subsets are created to identify theoretical quantiles and distributions of a smaller set of the data. 

## lab3.R

Numerous variables are considered in assessing youth morbidity and mortality. Sampling distributions were created to identify descriptive statistics and make inferences about the population parameter of interest.

## lab4.R

Data containing the demographics of those who believe they have been abducted by UFOs are considered. Data entry errors are ridded, and datasets are cleaned for practical usage in R. 

## lab5.R

Course evaluations are used to create useful datasets. One-sample t-tests and t-distributions are utilized to perform inference for a single mean, calculate p-values (test statistics), and t-scores (confidence intervals/levels).

## lab6.R

The dataset from lab3.R is utilized to perform numerous estimations (with a confidence interval) and testing (with a hypothesis test) on subset samples, assuming that the dataset represents the whole population.

## lab7.R

Various tests are conducted to study the impact of lead poisoning in children. Paired data is analyzed using a paired t-test. Quantitative responses in two independent groups are analyzed using a two-sample t-test.

## lab8.R

Demographics and conditions of patients with oropharyngeal cancer are analyzed. Inferences are made on categorical data utilizing a single proportion test, a two proportion test, and a chi-squared test of association.

## lab9.R

Datasets regarding the health of Emory students are analyzed. Correlation and simple linear regression is used to assess the linear association between quantitative variables. Model residuals are examined to determine if inferences are valid.
